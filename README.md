# Group generator

This is the result from a class hackathon where we got the assignment to create a program that can generate groups based on a list of names. The groups are generated by the user assigned group size and then the people are assigned to each group randomly.

## Utils.cpp
Contains QOL functions not assigned to any class.
- readNamesFromFile()
- writeGroupsToFiles()
- readGroupsFromFile()
- generateRandomNumber()
- printGroupsFromFile()

# Classes
All classes contained in the program.

## person.cpp
For each individual managed in the program
- getName()
- setName()

## persons.cpp
For each list of persons managed in the program
- generateNames()
- addPerson()
- removePerson()
- getList()

## group.cpp
For each individual group of person
- addMember()
- getGroup()

## groups.cpp
For a list of groups
- createGroups()
